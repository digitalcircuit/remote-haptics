Remote Haptics
===============

Remote Haptics explores how to integrate tactile feedback into Virtual/Augmented Reality experiences.  By separating out the haptics engine from AR/VR platform-specific code, this may provide an easier, more approachable way to harness the power of touch.

**Warning:** Very early work in progress, things may break, no warranty, etc.

## Setup

System needed:
* Python 3
* The Linux `evdev` Python module (support for Windows should happen in the future)
* Some sort of haptics device supported by the Linux force-feedback system (e.g. game controller with rumble)
* *To be done - expand this list?*

## Usage

* *To be done*

## Credits

* *To be done*
* *If you're missing, let me know, and I'll fix it as soon as I can!*
